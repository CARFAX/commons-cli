Jakarta Commons CLI
===================

Welcome to the CLI component of the Jakarta Commons project.

This component requires the excellent Ant utility.  It can 
be found here :

  http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/

For testing the project, you will also need JUnit:

  http://www.junit.org/

CLI uses the new jakarta-turbine-maven system for producing
lovely metrics and such:

  http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/maven/

Once you have these three components installed and configured,
simple type:

	ant

The system will build and test itself.

For complete documentation and to create a local copy of the
CLI project website, type:

	ant maven:site

Good luck!
