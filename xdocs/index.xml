    <section name="Jakarta Commons CLI">
      <p>
        The Jakarta Commons CLI library provides an API for processing command
        line interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        CLI1 was formed by the merger of ideas and code from three different
        libraries and allows most simple interfaces to be modelled.  CLI1
        became increasingly difficult to maintain and develop further and so
        CLI2 has been developed with the goals of clearer responsibilities and
        being more flexible.  The intention is that CLI2 should be able to
        model a far greater selection of interfaces and do so more completely,
        validating as much as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        The redesigned CLI2 is rooted in the <code>org.apache.commons.cli2</code>
        package and the distribution retains the <code>org.apache.commons.cli</code>
        package so that the upgrade doesn't break old code.  The CLI1 package
        should be regarded as deprecated to encourage the transition to the
        more flexible CLI2 framework but minor bug fixes and patches may be
        accepted to ensure that CLI1 based applications continue to function as
        expected.
      </p>

        The rest of the documentation is split into the followin three sections:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="manual/index.html">CLI2</a> - a reference manual for version 2</li>
          <li><a href="introduction.html">CLI1</a> - documentation for version 1 </li>
          <li><a href="examples/index.html">Examples</a> - a selection of worked examples demonstrating CLI2 features</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </section>
