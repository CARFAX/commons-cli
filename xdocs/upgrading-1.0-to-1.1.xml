<section name="Upgrading from 1.0 to 1.1">
  <p>CLI 1.1 is a bugfix release of CLI. The following changes were not backward compatible: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The CommandLineParser interface has two additional methods. If you were extending this,
        then you will need to add methods to your classes. If you were extending the abstract
        Parser class, then you should be okay. </li>
    <li>The HelpFormatter class had publicly accessible fields. These are now accessed via
        get/set methods. </li>
    <li>Two of HelpFormatter's methods no longer throw IllegalArgumentException. </li>
    <li>The Option class is no longer cloneable, and no longer has an addValue(String) method. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>The best way to test any of the above is to recompile your code against CLI 1.1. All of the above 
      should result in compile time errors. </p>
